    "detailed_description": "In the age of today's times and technology, everything is bigger, better and faster but some of us still prefer analog engagement of driving like medicine for the soul, this is the very last of those cars and one of the cleanest lowest mile examples on the market today. A car that was not mass produced and special with no need for introduction for the true driver. Most of these cars on the market have been thrashed and trashed with double and triple times the miles on them than this one and they are still all solid cars because they were built tough. I've not tracked this car but I have had it at high rates of speed and the back roads and it is a confident runner. It has one of the lightest configuration you can get with ceramic brakes so it is nimble and fun. The noise it makes is like no other and music to the ears. This car has had no accidents and has all of its original paint and is almost in the condition top, bottom, inside and out as it was when it rolled off the showroom floor. I have two keys the manual and a car cover to keep it that way. The car is stock other than a carbon fiber fab speed filter intake and sharkwerks exhaust. It needs nothing else and is the perfect blend for a crisp response of power all thru the rpms. The RS accents were done previously before I purchased it and they look factory with the wheels literally looking like candy and flawless. I've had the car with in the last 500 miles fully serviced all fluids and spark plugs done, it has new tires with in the last 2000 miles and needs nothing but a driver. Overrev DME report attached. Any questions please message me. Will entertain a possible trade or trades, up or down, air cooled, turbo, GT or specialty 911 porsche's only.  "

As some of you who know me know, I am a small time dealer. I typically deal in air cooled cars or other vintage cars. I worked for Porsche for 10 years and I know these cars and the markets well.  Very happy to answer any questions. Car is located at our farm in Bucks County PA.   Looking to move this car, might consider the right air cooled 911. I am NOT looking for a project.  PM me with questions.  Thanks very much.  "

This is a Porsche website, so I don't need to over-sell it... it's an R that has been totally set up for the track, but is in amazing condition with low miles and really, 20 track days is nothing for this motor! Anyone who has built a track car knows it's always less expensive to buy a track car than it is to build one (I didn't do most of the mods). I'm selling it to make room for a GT4... the ONLY car worthy of replacing this one (within reason!).  From the factory: 6-speed manual w/ factory short-throw shifter, Sport Chrono (added by dealer, so no dashboard wart), carbon fiber Sport Bucket Seats leather w/ alcantera, Limited Slip Differential (standard in the R), Bluetooth, and aux audio input.  Added: Xpel clear bra (installed prior to delivery from dealer), half-cage, 6-pt. harnesses, AiM Solo2 DL lap timer and data logger (connected to CAN BUS), TPC adjustable sways & droplinks, GT3 LCAs, GT3 Brake Master Cylinder, GT3 Throttle Body, GT3 Brake Cooling Ducts, IPD Plenum, aFe Pro Dry S air filter, SS brake lines, rear center jack point, folding front tow hook w/GoPro mount, Rennline pedals.  Recently replaced: Clutch slave & master cylinders, water pump, Mass-airflow sensor, spark plugs, slotted rotors (new), Stoptech performance street brake pads (4K miles ago). Tires have more than half the tread remaining. Oil change (6 months, 3 track days ago), but will change again for the sale. Gear oil 1 year ago (BG Synthetic, <5K miles and 6 track days). Brake fluid: SRF React (6 months and 3 track days ago).  Included with car: Pagid track pads (Front: Yellow RS29, Rear: Black), indoor-outdoor flannel-lined cover, and extra set of track wheels (OZ Ultraleggera 19\") & tires (R888R - 6 track days). It has everything you need for the street and/or track, and all expensive maintenance work has been done. Very hard to find one like this!  Car is located in Maryland, DC suburbs. Asking $69,500/obo.  "

The technician told me the 6 ignitions were most likely done at the factory on the dyno.  The car had a clear film on the front since new. In july of 2017 I had the Auto Spa in OKC do a full paint correction and re-apply SunTek PPF Ultra film (full front end coverage) and applied C.Quartz nano coating over the entire car.  The only mechanical issue was a water pump replacement at 15644 miles in sept of 2017  I purchased a Fidelity Platnum extended warranty for this car on 10-18-2017 for 6 years or 60,000 miles with a $250 deductible.

The limited edition RS Green paint was only available on this car and the GT3 RS from this year. The Sport had many upgrades over the Cayman S, including Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM), a 10mm lower ride height, factory Sport Exhaust, Sport Chrono, Bi-Xenon headlights, Sport Seats, alcantara interior trim which includes the GT3RS steering wheel, shift ****, and handbrake.  I have the original window sticker that shows the car was optioned with \"Sport model\", Paint to Sample RS Green paint, Sport Chrono Package Plus, full leather interior, PCM w/ extended navigation, heated front seats, 19\" Turbo wheels, Bose high-end sound package (sound is amazing). Total build out came out to $78,000!  I bought this car from the second owner. It's always been maintained well. It drives fantastic. No issues or lights on. Shifts smooth and the brakes are great. Recently put 4 new tires. The previous owner scraped the front spoiler and decided to put an aftermarket spoiler back on with the front air dam (GT3RS style). I have all the book and window sticker. The paint on the car is stunning. There's some road rash on the front bumper and light dent on the passenger fender that a PDR guy could press out. There is some curb rash on the driver's side front wheel. Car is clean and ready to enjoy. Completely stock except for the front spoiler. Clean and clear title. These cars are an absolute blast to drive. After owning this car I must say this is probably one of the best driving sports cars available. Only 700 S Sport models models made worldwide. 7 colors were offered, the two special colors were RS Green and RS orange. Priced to sell. Feel free to Pm me with any questions."

It's a beautiful Agate grey with a fairly rare natural red full leather. It has approx. 59.5K miles at the moment, and I purchased from a very conscientious and diligent Rennlist and PCA member in FL. I had it enclosed transported to the Bay Area and I've taken very good care of her since. The car had a $118K original price. The only things not listed are dealer installed: PSE, Burmester tweeters to replace the original Bose, and the paddle steering wheel. I have the original tweeters and the wheel that were replaced, and I have all records from the PO and records from my current ownership.   In the last two weeks I've had the 60K main service, 60K PDK flush, and new rear discs and pads done from a top shop here in the Bay Area. There are 2017 Pilot 4S with a lot of tread life left on all 4 corners. Small curb nick on one of the Carrera Classic wheels. Overall exterior condition is very good, some small rock chips and a slight scratch on the front bumper as would be expected with this age and mileage but other than that it's good. the paint shines brightly, the headlights are bright and clear without clouding. The interior is is excellent condition, the leathers is a 9/10.  During the previous ownership, the car was bumped in the rear from <5mph which left a slight crease in the bumper but no paint damage. It's so hard to see I had to have the PO send multiple videos to show me and I couldn't find it easily when I saw the car in person. I have the insurance estimate from PO showing the low cost to fix but he didn't think it was worth it to repaint and I agree.    Please reach here or via PM if you have any questions, want more info or would like additional photos. I'll try to add some additional ones later today. I have both keys, all books and manuals, etc."

The seats have aftermarket alcantara covers, but I have the original leather Porsche covers.  I also have the original seats which are not LWB.  The car has been stored and maintained by Speed Sport Tuning.  I am the second owner.  The car is flawless inside and out and as you can see only one of a rare few that came with Peridot colored wheels.  The tires are brand new Bridgestone Potenza RE71Rs, and the brakes have 50% life left and are Pagid Yellows.  I plan on using the proceeds from this car to purchase a Porsche G or I class car.  Sadly the days of my owning a race dedicated car AND a DE car are over, for now."

The exterior is black with a dark blue top and dark blue interior. I don't drive the car much anymore and am looking to purchase something more practical. Everything on the car is in perfect working order, nothing has ever been neglected or not repaired. Earlier this year I had the engine sent to L&N Engineering for a complete re-build(bored out to a 4.0 with all new pistons, bearings, IMS and bearing, etc..), total cost was around $12k including work done at the dealer and the cost of the machining done by L&N(I have receipts/invoices for all work). The car has been taken care of very well, always serviced at the dealership and always garage kept. There are some rock chips in the paint but no major damage. I just had the tires replaced(Michelin Super Sports) earlier this year and they have about 500 miles on them. Just had the oil changed about a month ago. I have both original key fobs and both work like new. I am motivated to sell and will entertain all offers.  "

    "detailed_description": "The time has come for me to list the first of my \"bucket list\" cars for sale. Purchased used by me in Feb. 2018 from an independent PORSCHE dealer in McLean, VA. 52,650 miles registered on the odometer at that time. In the 20 months of my ownership, approximately 4,500 miles have been added which brings the current odometer reading to 57,xxx. It is noted that until a sale is finalized, the mileage will slowly increase as I will continue to take her out on the nice and sunny weekends when in need of an adrenaline fix.  Though I have owned it for a short amount of time, I have treated the car as if I was going to keep it forever. I have spared absolutely no expense in bringing the car to what I would consider the most reliable and streetable state possible. A major engine service was performed in the beginning of 2019 as outlined here:  https://rennlist.com/forums/997-turb...997-turbo.html  Every major wear item known to fail on the engine was replaced. All coolant pipes were pinned. Sharkwerkes GT1 metal pipes were installed. New hoses, lines, gaskets, O-rings, spark plugs, ignition coils and more were all replaced. All vital fluids have been changed. Documentation of all work has been recorded in my own personal service and maintenance log and all receipts for parts have been retained and cataloged in a 3 ring binder. I can email the service and maintenance log to any interested parties for their review. I would not hesitate to drive this car anywhere.  Along with the major service, some tasteful and reversible modifications have been made. All OEM parts have been retained and will accompany the car (minus the factory shift cables- they were broken and thus, have been scrapped). These modifications include:  -H&R lowering springs -SONY XAVAX100 Apple carplay unit -KLINE SS catless exhaust -Numeric shifter box with cup car cables -Painted center console (carbon package trim had delaminated and cracked). -VOLK TE37's with ADVAN NEOVA tires. These are not included in the sale price and the car will be on factory wheels with new HANKOOK VENTUS V12 tires. Should an interested party wish to purchase the vehicle \"as it sits\", email me for a package price which will also include the factory wheels.  Aftermarket parts that were on the car when I purchased it include:  -Aftermarket LED tail lights -Electronic wing spoiler actuator rams  The factory parts for these have not been retained.  The vehicle will also be accompanied with a current and clean Carfax along with a somewhat recent clean autocheck report. DME reports can be done in person or via facetime. If you're looking for an all zero'd DME, this car is not for you. The car has indeed been loved, but at the same time- driven the way it should be. People with basic knowledge of internal combustion engines who know how to read the reports and what the numbers mean should have no problems with the single digits 3 ignition counts in 5 and 2 ignition counts in 6 - especially on a turbo car.  I have done what I can to make the car as perfect as can be; and you will find that it blurs the line between driver and garage queen very well. There are no major defects in the body and paint which has been professionally refined and protected with ceramic coating.  I also very recently had the front bumper/hood refinished to get rid of all the rock chips that had peppered it throughout the years.  The powertrain is sound and well sorted, and you would have no qualms about taking it out to dinner, parking it and getting caught in the rain on the way home.  Vehicle Information:  2007 PORSCHE 911 TURBO  VIN: WP0AD29917S785276  3.6L H6 F DOHC  -Black -Black full leather -Axle-differential lock rear -PCCB -Heated front seats -Rear window wiper -3-spoke multi function steering wheel -Sport chrono package turbo -Module for telephone PCM -Carbon Package -Floor Mats- interior color -Thicker leather steering wheel -Storage compartment lid w/model logo -Adaptive sport seats -Carbon door sill model insignia -Sport shifter -Rear center console - Carbon  ORIGINAL MSRP: 134,808.00  Asking $70,997.00 on Factory wheels.

The car drives like its brand new - the 997.2 direct fuel injection flat 6 is bullet proof. The car has been driven mostly on highway and around suburbs in San Francisco and now resides with me in Austin. I have service records and the car has been garage kept since I have owned it. I purchased it 2 years ago and got a full inspection of the car when I did - and it was in great condition then and still is now. I just paid $1k for its $60k mileage service. The tires have plenty of room to go also. Interior is in great condition. Exterior is also - there are a few small scratches around the car and some small paint chips on the hood - otherwise its in great condition. The manual transmission is the icing on the cake for this car. I have driven several 911s and I love them all and I know that PDKs are faster, but driving a 997.2 with a manual transmission is just more fun than driving one with a PDK in my humble opinion. Just drove a friend's 2018 991 PDK - yes its faster and awesome, but the 997.2 is just more fun and classic in my opine.  Anyway - recently had my second kid and my wife wants me to get an SUV so hence this post.  Please feel free to message me if interested or have questions / only serious inquiries please.  I prefer to sell the car - but if someone wants to trade me for a 2018/2019 Toyota Landcrusier that can be discussed.  "

Many of the modifications were done prior to our purchase, and we have refined it to be a weapon on the track. We purchased it from the second owner who used it as a track car at VIR and he bought it in 2011, we took delivery in June of 2015 with roughly 21k miles.   I have consistently run in the 1:47-1:48 range at Heartland Park Topeka with with setup over the past 2 years once switching to the Pirelli DH. It has had nothing but the finest mechanic Karl Wilen from Rennsport KC do all the tuning and wrenching, outside of the stuff I do myself. I would be happy to take to him for a PPI. I do know it has a power steering leak that I have not looked into, and will likely take to Karl to repair.   The oil has always been changed after every 2 weekends with XP9 from Joe Gibbs. If doing some street driving which is really rare I would run DT40. Currently has a fresh oil change to DT40.

The car is currently wrapped with a Martini livery but has our business name in place of the Martini. This could easily be removed. I will say the paint will probably not be perfect as there has been some track rash and places where the wrap has been rubbed. I do know that when they were wrapping the car the drivers door had some clear that came off.  Car is located just north of Kansas City, MO and is stored in a climate controlled garage.  Asking $42,000 for the car with all spares, and I am open to offers. Not interested in parting out, goes as a package   https://vinanalytics.com/car/WP0AB29925S740611/  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-3..._nnoKCmuxubAQk"

The car has 22,000 Miles (36,000KM) only. Originally a US Car. Great options and unique build. I will go through them in detail below along with the story of the car. This 2011 GTS rear-wheel drive combined with an extra punch of power at 408 bhp from the naturally aspirated 3.8 liter flat six and the Porsche Sports Exhaust system with black pipes and signature GTS badging is stunning!  All service up to date and done at Porsche dealer. Brand new breaks and brake calipers at 10,000 miles (16,000km), brand new battery, brand new windshield wipers. More recent work below.

Work done on May23rd.

The car was imported from the US with only 300 miles on it, so basically a brand new car. It then spent all its life in Victoria and vancouver where there is very little snow and no salty road. Front portion (hood, bumper, mirrors) is wrapped in a clear bra paint protection since day one. The paint is in brand new condition.   The Seats** This car is equipped the Carbon Fiber Sport Bucket Seats which on its own is VERY rare on GTS. BUT on this car they are in Sand Beige leather. The Porsche dealer that ordered this car must have had immense pull with the factory in Germany as I have not seen any bucket seat in any colour other than black. These seats are available on the 997.2 GT3 GT3RS GT2RS and 991.1/.2 GT3s GT3RS but only in black. To get these seats is around a $10k option, to get them in a Porsche Exclusive finish of your choice is probably over a $25,000 option and I believe it is no longer offered. I have posted on rennlist about the seats and no one has ever seen another like it.   Wheels The wheels are factory painted as the body colour (Carrera white). It is stunning and with the -20mm drop and red break calipers makes it a very very unique package. Another benefit is that you don't have to deal with the headache of centerlock wheels and have to tow your car to Porsche every time you need to take them off.   Alcantara Deletion No fake suede. Instead replaced with natural leather. The headliner is still Alcantara.   All dials in white, including the sport chrono, to match the exterior.   Here is your chance to own the most amazing GTS of the total production of 2,656 GTS Coupes built in the world!!  **One Claim regarding replacement of the front bumper. My wife was pulling out her Macan from our parking spot and her tire caught on to the front left side of the bumper and pulled it off its attachment. The cost of the bumper was $5,500 so I decided to pay my deductible to replace it. I have all corresponding paperwork for the bumper replacement.   Dealers: All offers will politely be ignored.   I would really like to sell this to a Porsche enthusiast.   Please direct message me if you have any questions"

This car has participated in some DE events.  It is my weekend car on nice days and does not see any track time. It would make a great DE driver for somebody else. I just can't justify it after having the repaint completed ($$) and owning a whole other track car.  *CA Residents: This car was sold new in Beverly Hills but... The tune I had put on has the catalyst monitor in a \"Not Ready\" status by request. The car used to have cat-less headers but I had them removed and the OEM exhaust manifolds are back on the car and the cats are good.

Brake mods - Girodiscs, Pagid yellows, GT3 master cylinder and ducts, braided stainless steel brake lines.  When purchased 3 years ago at 8,500 miles, the car had never been tracked. I had a NEW LONG BLOCK MOTOR from Porsche installed last summer at 16,060 miles. (See photo pre-install, it's the last pic) Only a handful of track events on the new motor. It runs like a banshee, and still has one year remaining on Porsche warranty.  This is an incredible, and very fast, Cayman R track beast.

Miles will go up very little as it's a weekend/fun/nice weather car. The previous owner put half of those miles on it the 2 years he owned it. All of the following has been done by myself except the ducktail, bumper, and springs. Everything I've done has been within the last 500 miles, including the detail. Previous owner stated having just changed the windshield and spark plugs before I purchased the car. I've also just changed the fluids. The car has been street only with zero track time. However, it has seen 2 mountain runs, hah!  This is a very well optioned car, I'm not aware of anything it's missing other than the factory telephone feature.

Bushings are fine but a little worn, as expected for a 12 year old car. Shocks in good shape.  Car was used for road trips, fun drives, and occasional commuting and shows normal signs of wear. A few rock chips on the hood and scuffs on interior plastics around the trunk. Interior carpet is spotless and includes a set of Weathertech mats along with the originals. Car has never been tracked (but autocrossed once for fun). Never money shifted, and the DME report I had done before I purchased the car showed 3 ignitions in range 3, none in ranges 4-6. Previous owner installed a SpeedART exhaust that I've been very happy with, but otherwise the car is unmodified.  Feel free to get in touch for more info/photos!"

I recently installed Corbeau seats on sliders and 5 pt harnesses with a RSS harness bar and the third center radiator.  It has the Porsche GT 4 aero package with splitter, rear wing and side scoops. I also have the smile grill that is not yet installed. It was lowered with H&R springs and it has new brake pads with Castrol SRF fluid. I used BGB Motorsports alignment and suspension specs with RSS front toe and bump steer kit. It has a Porsche GT 3 brake booster and Tarrett Eng. sway bars.

    "detailed_description": "I bought this car two years ago to drive Chinn events at Sebring and Daytona. I wanted to upgrade my driving experience and safety on the track. I have had a ton of fun in this car and learned what i needed from it. Personal best lap time was a 2.22 with a handful of 2;23s and a ton of 2.24s, at Sebring. My local shop had serviced the car for a while so i knew a little about it. I dont have a full history on the car but i have a link that has seems to have an origin, and since the car has traded from two shops what see you listed on other sites might not be accurate. Car is turn key and track ready. i have kept up on routine stuff and rear axles were replaced. as far as what class this car falls into, i dont know. i can make car available to local shop for inspection. car has coolshirt system. sequential shifter  extra set of bbs wheels"

It has been brought current on all required maintenance since May. Oil change (May 2019)/brake fluid & PDK fluid changed (August 2019)/40k service was done in 2018/new air filters (July 2019)/new front tires (May 2019)/new rear tires (August 2019). New plastic film ahead of rear wheels installed (June 2019) along with a new ash tray door, trim piece around the ignition, new lug nuts, and new plastic pieces ahead of front tires on the bottom of the front bumper. The front bumper has a couple of minor imperfections from a prior owner bumping into something vertical, but I haven't repaired them (though I applied some heat to minimize the one at the lower edge of the driver's side brake duct opening). The interior is in great shape after replacing the cosmetic items mentioned above. The passenger seat has two repairs in it from a prior owner that are very good, but noticeable upon close inspection. New all weather mats were purchased and new ceramic tint (the lightest option available) installed. Sport Chrono Package installed by Gossett Porsche, so that's why there is no dash wart but the Sport and Sport Plus buttons are there and working. This car is great; selling it in favor of going back to a different daily driver and buying a Cayman S for weekend driving. Car is ready to go with no required maintenance until its next oil change. Clear title in hand. Buy at a discount before the end of November 2019 (when my tax credit expires) as I'll raise the price, keep the car, and sell in the spring for $53,000."

Car gets regular oil changes with molbil one synthetic. I checked the coolant, and topped it off when i installed the third center radiator. Battery was replaced last summer (2018). New factory radio *****.  EXTRAS: Fabspeed cup exhaust with black chrome tips, Fabspeed carbon fiber intake, Fabspeed ECU tune, Aftermarket 19\" wheels, Third center radiator from suncoast, Aftermarket LED halo headlamps, Aftermarket LED tail lights, LED exterior lights, Nav tv ipod adapter, H&R lowering springs, Tinted windows, Mesh grilles in front bumper.  PAINT: Repainted by myself (its what i do). Riviera Blue, All PPG products, 4 coats of clear, flat sanded and rubbed. Syngergized Systems coating applied (its a hybrid ceramic coating. saves a ton of time on washing). All the jambs, roof and center of spoiler painted in semi gloss black. When i bought the car, it was silver, i hate silver. There was no bodywork done on the car, just a color change. Overall the paint looks great. It does have a couple stone chips, just from normal driving. Paint is 3 years old.  GENERAL INFORMATION/ CONDITION: Car runs, drives, sounds and looks great. Interior is in good condition with normal wear for the mileage. Tires are in great shape. Car Fax shows zero accidents and one damage report. The damage report is from me. I hit a groundhog on the freeway in April of 2018. It got a new front bumper under insurance. The bumper was purchased from suncoast. I have pics of the damage if anyone would like to see it. I also have a pic of the car when i first purchased it, when it was silver. The frunk switch inside the car quit working recently, but still works off the fob (the engine lid switch still works). The exterior LED lights do throw lights on the dash. It never bothered me, but can be easily fixed by installing regular bulbs. The headlights and tail lights do not throw any lights on the dash. The factory Bi-xeon head lamps are in great condition and will go with the car. The factory tail lights and factory springs will also go with the car. If buyer is interested, i can include the slightly damaged old front aero kit bumper and an extra set of trim pieces. Its easily repairable. Price is firm. Only trade i will even entertain is a Ford Raptor"

THE GOOD: Very clean example that was used as a daily driver reliably for nearly the last three years. Recently did a 3,200-mile road trip this summer with no issues whatsoever. The car has been in the San Diego area since new.  THE BAD: Windshield is pitted somewhat as the result of following a Porsche GT3 with Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires during a desert canyon run out by Ocotillo Wells. The driver side door has a scratch from freeway debris that was subsequently touched up (see photo.) The passenger side rear fender was scratched by my kid's bicycle and subsequently touched up (see photo.) I had an idiotic single-car accident that required a new front bumper cover, passenger side headlight, and passenger side radiator. Repaired via insurance at my choice of body shop, and no sheet metal was replaced or removed during the repair. PM for more details.  Title in hand. CARFAX available upon request"

It has never been tracked in my possession but I have auto crossed the car.  Not sure of the previous owner as the car was purchased from a VW dealer where the previous owner traded it in.  The vehicle is well maintained with a bunch of maintenance just performed.  At the end of last year the rear pads and rotors were replaced along with 4 new Michelin Pilot 4S tires installed.  All 4 tires currently measure 9/32nds.  The headliner was also recovered with factory Porsche material as it had fallen down.  This June, the following maintenance was performed; oil change, brake flush, cabin filter replaced, engine air filter replaced, new engine belt, all plugs and coils replaced.  The over rev read out was done at that time and the car has only 52 in range 2. I have most receipts for the vehicle but not all.  The build sheet is as follows;  342  Heated Front Seats  403  19\" Carrera S Wheel  435  3-Spoke Sport Steering Wheel  475  PASM  498  Delete Model Designation  573  Automatic Climate Control  639  Sport Chrono Pkg W/Out PCM  680  Bose High End Sound Package  AP    Black Sport Seats  B4    Carrera White  CGA Headlight Cleaner Cvr. Ext. Clr  CRX  Wheels Painted in Dev. Color  P74  Bi-Xenon Headlamp Package  P77  Leather Sport Seats  XLF  Sport Exhaust System  Total MSRP  72,530.   The car has never been in an accident in my possession and as far as I know, none with the previous owner.  The Carfax is clean.  There are some minor issues around the vehicle.  There is a small door ding on the passenger door.  There are normal rock chips here and there.  The paint on the front bumper has some slight cracks right above the plate bracket.  I think someone tapped the front bumper in a parking lot.  Both rock gaurds on the rear quarter panels are discolored from age.  The PORSCHE writing has faded from the left two brake calipers as well.  Other than that the interior is in good shape with just normal wear.  Everything works as it should.  Car drives great and was told no other work was needed after the last service was performed in June."

The car was previously in the south (Tennessee and Florida) until I bought the car in September 2017. The car has been stored during winters with my ownership, so no driving in freezing temperatures or road salt in its life time. I have all service history.  Recent Maintenance: Fixed drivers door latch (wasn't springing back when I purchased) Coolant tank replaced Motor mounts replaced New tires (Sumitomo HTRIII) as of 2/2019 PA inspected as of 2/2019  Condition/issues: Paint is in very good shape. Some minor scratches and paint chips, I would say above average overall for age and mileage. Clear vinyl in front of rear wheels is discolored. I have replacement vinyl. Can include or replace for buyer. Interior is in great shape. Some wear on center console near seat.  Slight noise (clicking) coming from dash when climate control is on. My guess is maybe a noisy blend door. Has been that way since I have owned it, and it hasn't been a nuisance enough for me to resolve. Climate control (heat/AC) function without issue."

We acquired this car from one of our top clients and the car is a textbook example of an extremely well maintained Cayman R with zero issues. Having owned a previous Cayman R before that we extensively tracked, we can speak very well to the capabilities of the car and how good it is for someone looking to get into the sport or just have a car that is an excellent daily commuter. The R's were made in much smaller quantities than the other Cayman trims and feature a little more horsepower and better suspension and aero. In addition to the very attractive factory options, this R has been lightly modded with some excellent track mods for someone desiring a bit more performance from the car. Those mods include the following: custom half cage by TC Designs, Schroth harnesses, fire extinguisher, Tubi exhaust, GT3 master brake cylinder, stainless steel brake lines, RSS semi-solid transmission mounts, RSS split-style lower control arms, Girodisc rotors, Racekeeper data logger with two HD cameras. The car was DE'd for around 2k track miles and the remainder of the miles are all street. It was never off the track in any way and there have been zero accidents or paintwork of any kind. The full front of the car is covered with PPF film and there are no noticeable imperfections on the exterior of the car. The interior is in excellent condition as well with bolsters, steering wheel, and shifter **** showing minimal wear. The car comes complete with manuals, original window sticker, two keys, service records and all original parts for the car.

The car is all stock with exception of the headunit which is replaced with bluetooth CarPlay/android touchscreen unit. I will include original radio with car also. I also have clear side lens markers which I did not install. Selling because I don't have garage space and have a company car. Inspection passed in September. The car will need oil change next year.

Car comes on Ohlins R&T Suspension and BBS E88 18x9/18x12\" wheels with Toyo R888R tires with 2 summers on them (literally both things are brand new - less then 2k miles on Suspension and less then 5k miles on wheels/tires).  When suspension was installed ALL shock/strut mounts were replaced with new Porsche ones.  Car has had recent oil, coolant, waterpump, thermostat, belt, all rollers, and new battery services. Also comes with a Carbon fiber Fabspeed intake and a stock air intake is included.  Extra piece not installed is a Carbon Fiber Ducktail spoiler made by Misha Designs.  Car has 85k miles. Most of it's life it spend in South - I brought it to NY 2 years ago - so car has rock chips on the front area, nothing horrible. At some point one of the P/O's had a rear sport bumper and exhaust upgades installed, and had front end resprayed, not uncommon for Southern cars.  I do not drive this car between October and May. I try not to drive it in rain either. Almost all miles on it are highway miles. Car and wheels could use a good detail.  There are 2 dash lights - one is for TPMS sensors which are not available and a brake light that is on after coilover suspension got installed (no problems) - both brakes work flawless.  Also I let the inspection run out on it because its about to be stored for Winter and inspection is due in September.  These are hard to find under $30k with somewhat low miles and clean title. I have receipts for things I've done since I own it but didn't get anything from P/O. This car has way over $10k in upgrades/maintenance/extra's. Car is not perfect, but I am VERY open to REASONABLE offers.   Just lowered my price because I found something else I want to buy.    No trades, I would drive this car anywhere in States.  EDIT: some new pics of the scratches mentioned, interior shot, and vin tag  https://rennlist.com/g/album/15183596  any interest send me a message, if the add is up then the car is available"

I've owned this vehicle for about 5 years after purchasing pre-owned from Ed Carroll Porsche in Fort Collins, CO (had just come off of it's CPO warranty when I bought it). I have all service records from my ownership. In the past 5,000 miles I've done tires (Michelin Pilot Sports), new spark plugs (part of the 40K mile service), control arms, and engine mounts. Annual service done each fall. This car is my summer fun car and has not been driven in the snow during my tenure. Full leather interior looks beautiful still smells new. Highly desirable PASM and SportChrono options. Black paint is in good condition and has great depth and shine for it's age - had it professionally paint corrected about 3 years ago. Washed by hand (2 bucket system etc.) nearly every week since - paint is smooth, but given it's black, there are some slight swirls in it. There are the normal rock chips expected with a Colorado driven car. Car has been extremely reliable with only normal maintenance and wear items needing care. All work done by Berg Performance in Arvada, Colorado. Buttons and climate control toggles are in good shape with no major peeling. Love this car and am not looking to blow it out, but I'm driving it less now that my daughter has more going on during weekends and is out growing the back seat. I picked up a '16 Cayenne GTS that is now seeing most of the miles."

Up for sale is my 2009 911 Carrera cab, because of my job relocation, I moved from CA to PA last year, and bought this car from Porsche Bethesda last June. The car was meant to be my DD, unfortunately, I underestimated how much PA has, which I had double confirmed with my coworkers even before I purchased the car, they all said I should be fine driving it around in the winter, turned out to be false. I had to literally rent another AWD as my DD for the winter, which added more cost meanwhile not be able to enjoy what I really wanted to drive instead. So here I am, hoping to find her a new home, and then go to another way, maybe a 4S or a gated R8, we will see.  I am the 3rd owner, the car was purchased from Porsche Bethesda as a trade-in from one of their best customers, I have all the service records before/after the purchase. Spent $0 to the date, other than gas/insurance, the car needs nothing. Just had a service last month, was told the brake has about 50% left, and tires were mint when I bought the car, have done anything crazy ever since, no track, no 0-60, no drag race or what so ever. The car is located in Chambersburg, PA.  Again, thanks for taking your time reading through my post, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I am not the best photographer in town, but if there is any specific place that you want to inspect, I will do my best to take some pictures for you.  Thanks and have a nice day!"

We are only selling because life circumstances have opened up opportunity for us to increase our travel and trying to open up funds to do so. This vehicle's specs are classic example of the 997, exactly what we were looking for -- last gen of Metzger engine!  Aesthetics: Black, Coupe, Porsche Emblem on Headrests Transmission: Manual Brakes: Standard (Non-Ceramic) Interior: NON-Multifunction Steering Wheel, Black Leather Mileage: LOW, currently 11,256 miles  Vehicle was purchased by us in April 2018 from RSM Motors. We live in Jackson, WY. Never tracked or drive irresponsibly. Just for relaxing cruises around our home.  NanoTech coating was professionally applied by dealer when we purchased. It's extremely effective, protective, and noticeable. Since our ownership, we have never touch washed the vehicle  With the coating, it's very effective to foam gun spray and air dry the car!  It's always been garaged w/ battery on tender (included) and never driven in inclement weather. Also includes: Porsche stretch cover, Manual, (2) Keys. Will work with buyer to arrange shipping, etc. Clean title in hand.  None of these on the market from what we could find. The few I've found for sale similar are higher priced. Please contact me directly for more photos, videos, questions, whatever you need. Thanks for your interest!"

    "detailed_description": "For sale is a 2005 Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet. This highly sought-after car is in excellent condition both inside and out, runs and drives exceptionally well, and has no driveability issues.  This 45,590-mile car has been well cared for and maintained by the current owner of two years. The triple black car is equipped with a factory replacement engine M96/03AT66567294, 3.6 liter, flat six-cylinder with 320 hp at 6,800 rpm and 273 foot-pounds of torque at 4,250 rpm, which powers the car from 0-60 mph in a quick 5.5 seconds, and achieves a top speed of 177 mph. The IMS bearing was replaced in the factory replacement engine prior to being installed in 2016 at 43,194 miles. The engine is mated to a five-speed Tiptronic transmission with the clutchless manual shifting feature, ABS and driveline traction control, power-assisted rack and pinion steering, and power four-wheel ventilated discs brakes. The car rolls on 18-inch silver alloy wheels shod with Continental Extreme Contact 235/40/ZR18 tires in the front and 265/40/ZR 18 in the rear.  The Cabriolet's suspension is independent MacPherson strut-type on the front, and independent multi-link on the rear, with coil springs both front and rear. The Porsche Stability Management electronically controlled system helps maintain control in the event of a skid. The safety package consists of the Porsche Side Impact Protection system comprising head and thorax airbags for both the driver and front-seat passenger, two full-size frontal airbags, three-point seatbelt latch pretensioners, and belt force limiters for the front seats, along with flat cushions fitted along the bottom rim of the side windows which inflate in a side-impact. Rollover protection is provided by a combination of high-strength steel bars in the A-pillars and two supplemental safety bars located behind the rear seats that automatically extend should the car start to roll.   Features for the 911 include all the standard amenities, such as air conditioning, power windows, power locks with keyless remote, cruise control, leather height-adjustable seats with power recliners, a digital AM/FM/CD stereo, trip computer, leather telescoping steering wheel, power windows, heated exterior mirrors, front and rear fog driving lights, and a speed-dependent retractable rear spoiler. For open-air driving pleasure and convenience, the Cabriolet is equipped with an electronic soft top that opens or closes in 20 seconds and can be deployed or retracted with the car moving at up to 30 mph. To protect its heated glass window, the top retracts in a Z-configuration with its outer side facing up. Recent service includes replacement of the control arms, hood and hatch struts, expansion tank, front stabilizer links, o-ring in the oil separator hose, crankshaft oil seal, and new tires. In addition, the soft-top hydraulic cylinder was rebuilt and the headliner was replaced, along with the front headliner panel and frame elastics were replaced.  This car is a great opportunity for someone to drive one of the most acclaimed sports driving machines that has stood the test of time, with a reputation for technology, performance, design, and style. The 911 remains the standard by which other sports cars are judged, and the 2005 raised the standard. The car is in the Seattle area, and has a clean title. Asking price is $26,500.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Link to photos:  https://photos.app.goo.gl/v1UMa58AvyDLhrqbA"

Personal note on the car: I did the last 2 races with the car, it's one of the most sorted Cup's I've ever driven, feels just out of the factory. Brake feel is bang on, every shift is crisp, never had a bad lap in it! Hate to see it leave the shop but she needs a new home."

This car has no modifications, aside from the clear side markers installed by the original owner. I am the second owner of this car, and have thoroughly enjoyed it. This car has been my primary vehicle for my commute over the past few years and 95% of the miles I put on were highway miles.  This vehicle is well documented. I have all service records from the dealer where I had this car serviced, as well as documentation on maintenance I performed myself.  Oil changes were performed every 5,000-7,500 miles. A recent Blackstone oil analysis returned excellent remarks.  I have complete confidence that any buyer will be surprised at the exceptional condition of this car. I am more than happy to take this car to a local shop or dealer for a PPI and can work with shipping companies for long distance buyers.  The title is clean and in hand, with no liens on the car.

I bought it with low miles, as a Porsche Certified car. I've had only one mechanical problems with the car, and the car has never been involved in any accidents. The mechanical problem was that the turn signal stopped turning off, that was an easy repair I did myself. My son and I are gearheads, and have done all oil changes, and we're a Mobil 1 family.  The car has the Turbo wheel set and ceramic brakes.  This is a lovely Guards Red Porsche 911 Turbo S. The paint is in great shape and shines beautifully. The interior is black leather with contrasting red stitching. The seat belts and guage trim are also in a contrasting red, making for a very striking overally interior. The car has the premium Bose sound system and integrated navigation system, along with FM/AM and 6-CD player.  The car has 54,900 miles.  Please feel free to ask me questions, it is equally outrageously fast and gorgeous.  Thanks!"

It is a spec I spent some time looking for including; heated, manual sport seats, a manual transmission, PASM, and a 3.6L engine. The car has been fantastic during my ownership. Reason for the sale: I am looking to move into something aircooled. I would be extremely happy keeping this car if it does not sell.  The exterior of the car is an 8/10 with the paint being in excellent/ above average condition- the car is a driver having lived its life in the northeast, it does show some rock chips indicative of its use and age. It has been garaged since the second owner. It had typical rust on the exhaust and suspension components, which have since been replaced. I performed an extensive paint correction and ceramic coating using Meguires 105, Jescar finishing polish, and Carpro CQuartz.   The exterior shows 4 pinky nail sized, PDR-able dents, two on the hood by the windshield, one on the front driver fender, and one on the roof. These are all very minor and not easily visible unless pointed out. The underbody has some scraping synonymous with lowered cars (and even non lowered- steep driveway to the garage). Lastly, there is a mark on the rear d/s bumperette from what appears to be a license plate.  The interior is also an 8/10 with one very small mark in the driver seat and some creasing on the side bolster- nothing excessive, the PO was a smaller man and I am a 6 foot 160 lb. individual. Additionally, there are some visible scuffs and marks on the hardbacks.   All maintenance and modifications are listed below in chronological order going back to 2,058 miles. Significant maintenance includes:  Lower Control arms at 24K Clutch replacement 34K HPFP 36K Intake Manifold Gasket & Air Oil Separator 37K Strut mounts and Ohlins R&T to replace leaky PASM 38K  I have the full maintenance history on the car, with invoices dating back to September 21, 2011.   I have also provided a DME readout from my time of purchase, I do not suspect this has changed as I drive the car as intended but have never hit the limiter. I am also happy to provide the Carfax from the previous owners time of purchase, as well as mine to link the history of the car.

I have also added an alcantara shifter, clear corners, a Fabspeed carbon intake, and an FVD exhaust. The roof racks are included with the sale.  There are a few items missing from the list above- everything listed; however, is verified via invoices.   The car is located in Boston, MA, but I frequently travel to CT.   Clean title, non-smoker; however, there is a lien on the car. I am asking $48K with LMs OBO.  All stock parts will be included (including stock wheels) with the sale of the car with the exception of the stock PASM shocks and the stock midpipe- they were both in very poor condition.  Welcome PPIs at the buyer's expense, happy to suggest some notable shops in the area to organize. Feel free to post or PM with any questions.                                       <img src=\"https://cimg2.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1333/img_8682_4e05c52295b27e87177341c1e90d97725c1ebadf.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                         <img src=\"https://cimg0.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1333/img_7011_71078acc1d4eb1f8d36e4b541bbf375eb0e84343.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1389/img_7021_5a2b29fa169390a8d7b10d39d8ccb1fb5724dffe.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                 <img src=\"https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1080x808/img_20190625_192719_415_2c3c5e79c7364350bd790027e3d8de62ffc57795.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1080x808/img_20190625_192731_061_71b294c78a9ff61cc018bf0d156e4345954cdc9c.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg8.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1080x808/img_20190625_192737_566_b98b5ff91a01257862619f676bb9e8722356fa76.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg7.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1080x808/img_20190625_192735_371_79a044ef117641f36ca71bbae40e1b24fd3d52aa.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/1080x808/img_20190625_192741_358_023f2d71f70e131d1d03fab28c10daf077782b72.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg9.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_20190619_173909_a2d39c59ef27100387c3468934f7c0640c25244c.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg4.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_20190619_174100_d4774814959953d77dde39099865fb699018c912.jpg\" alt=\"\" />                                                  <img src=\"https://cimg6.ibsrv.net/gimg/rennlist.com-vbulletin/2000x1504/img_20190619_173927_da331d212786944982e9d11197fb8158a2a65a53.jpg\" alt=\"\" />              "

Very few cars in this model year can be found with a PDK transmission and the paddle shift sport steering wheel combo. Don't be fooled by cars with the old push button system. No need to worry about getting stuck in traffic because it's an automatic but when you want to blast through the canyons, bump over to PDK manual mode and enjoy the thrill of tapping through the gears!  Recently used at Porsche club technical education session. The world class installers at Premier Auto Armor did an amazing job making this car look better than brand new.  Over $7500 in recent paint protection & detail work.

It's just back from Porsche of Reno from an oil change and got a clean bill of health. It's sitting on newer all-season tires. I can share the clean carfax. It currently has just under 61k miles. Asking $42.9k.  This car has been driven and there are a few dings and scratches. But it is a clean car that runs beautifully.  I'd prefer to find a local buyer in Northern Nevada or California. I have the car financed with Wells Fargo. I'm located near Lake Tahoe just a short drive from Reno-Tahoe International Airport. I can be reached by email at [email protected]"

This car has been my daily driver for the past 3 years, but being my 5th car it's time to move on. I have owned 11 different Porsche's and currently have a 996TT and 08 Cayman S. I've been an enthusiast for all of my life, and I maintain my cars like one. Oil changed with Mobil 1 Synthetic 0-W40 every 3-5000 miles. This car needs nothing to the best of my knowledge mechanically. I would drive it from CT to CA without hesitation. I have a clean CT title in hand and two keys. Also have a new set of floor mats and the rear window screen. It has the sport chrono option. Also has the rear wiper and tinted rear and side mirrors which are VERY nice options for a daily driver. Sport button really wakes the car up and I never drove without it on. Headers and exhaust made a big difference but I'm confident it will be too loud for most so I'm including the stock exhaust (car has CE from the headers). The following maintenance has been done in different time frames. I have most of the receipts for the parts as I do most of the work myself or with a friend of mine who owns a shop. Last 1000 miles: New Pirelli Sottozero Tires all around New Plugs and Coils New Rear Pads, Rotors and Parking Brake pads New Headlight and Fog Light Bulbs New Drivers side window motor and Window Guides New Front wipers Last 5000 Miles New Headers, Catback and O2 Sensors Loud will come with stock exhaust and headers New Struts and Mounts all around New Front Control Arms, Front and Rear Sway Bar Endlinks, Inner and Outer Tie Rod Ends New Front Pads and Rotors (did the rear pads and found out I needed new rotors hence them just being done) New Brake pad wear sensors New Starter  Water pump was done Right before I bought it and coolant flushed.  These engines are NOT plagued like the other Porsche's of this era with IMS or cylinder wall scoring. This car will go for another 100,000 miles without skipping a beat. Never left me stranded. Been nothing but a pleasure to drive.  The only issues with this car are cosmetic. The headliner is sagging. I went back and forth about fixing it but I will let the new owner decide which route to go. Also as pictured there is a dent on the drivers rear quarter from some A$$Hole who pulled and hit and run in a parking garage. When I pointed it out my girlfriend couldn't even see what I was talking about. I'm particular about dents. There is also a dent on the passenger rear where someone opened their door into the car. Also minor. The hood has rock chips as does the front bumper. It also has some spidering in the paint. The windshield also has some rock chips. I can meet someone anywhere in CT or Boston area. I am in Boston every weekend and in Fairfield county every Monday. You'll be hard pressed to find a better sorted Cayman at this price point! Feel free to text or call me. I'm going to give it a week or two here then off to the Bay. Also the car will come clean! ;-)  860-808-8401 Chris"

It was polished, waxed, and coated to keep the beautiful shine. The leather interior is damage free, not even a single abnormal wrinkle in the seats.  It's brought me great joy in owning this car but realize it's time to give it up to enjoy my other cars.  $56,000 CAD firm.

    "detailed_description": "For Sale - Ski Motorsports 2009 Porsche Cayman Built for the IMSA Continental Tire Series, this Cayman has the 2.9 liter engine and 6-speed manual transmission with only 39k original miles. Our technical partner for this project was Bodymotion Racing from Ocean, New Jersey, with multiple race wins in the series and over 30 years racing Porsches following their \"blueprint\" insured a solid finished product without any guess work. The Mosing Racing 2014 and 2017 championship winning car was built by Bodymotion using this blueprint. The roll cage was done by Bodymotion at their shops and the two-way JRZ RS Pro shocks were setup to their specs by their shock supplier. Current spring rates are for VIR, setup data will be provided. The car features, two-piece 996 GT2 control arms, TPC adjustable sway bars and adjustable toe links. The braking system was upgraded with 996 calipers and the Bosch Motorsports M4 ABS control unit. Built for endurance racing, the car has a full cool suit system, dry-break fuel filler, auxiliary fuel pump to empty the tank, fuel cell foam, full IMSA-spec safety nets, six nozzle fire system and a Motorola Radio. Additional components include, Moly-coated NASCAR style wheel studs and sixty hardened, coated lugs, FabSpeed Headers and a transmission cooler with pump. IMSA rules have made this car no longer eligible for the pro series but it would be an excellent choice for PCA, Cayman Cup, NASA, HSRA vintage endurance or as a track day car. With well over $100K in receipts and hours invested, it would be difficult to duplicate for the asking price of $72K. This is a rare opportunity to own what is effectively a brand new race car. A complete Krontec air-jack system was purchased but not installed, the invoice cost was $6500, it can be included with the purchase of the car for an additional $5k.The car is currently at our shop at Summit Point Raceway, please contact us with any questions.

It's hard to find an actual last-year-of-production 997.2 Carrera S with manual transmission. The 2012 997.2 is several \"last of\"s. If you're looking you already know this. Last short wheel base 911. Last \"pendulum dynamics\" 911. Last naturally aspirated Carrera engine. Last 911 with hydraulic steering. Last DIY-able 911. Oil changes don't even require lifting the car - the drain plug is accessible with a long reach from the rear; the oil filter is accessible in the engine compartment. Engine air filters are easily accessible from the intimate rear hatch. Even engine mounts are supposedly easy although I haven't tried that one.  Originally the car was sold new in FL and returned with about 5k miles. This car was formerly a CPO car owned by a retired Rennlist member in California who put about 40k gentle miles on the car. I purchased it with 47k miles and also kept it in California. It has an excellent service history. Oil has been changed every 3k-5k miles throughout its life.  Cosmetically the car is not concourse perfect so if you're looking for that, this is not your car, but it has few blemishes relative to its 56k miles. I had the clear bra installed on top of the blemishes to halt additional road rash, but wanted to keep the original paint so what you see is what you get. Paint is overall in great swirl free condition. I got this car as a mechanically stellar driver, although I ended up not driving it much.  To see how the car has been driven and maintained, one has to look no further than the Blackstone reports and the DME report. Only 525 overrevs in range 1 and nothing else. That's barely hitting the rev limiter a handful of times. The Blackstone reports attached are amazing. I hesitate to sell this car on that fact alone. I was told Porsche engines burn oil but I've never seen the oil level drop on this car between oil changes. I'd hate to let it go but it's time to get something more appropriate to my use case.  Clean CA title in hand. No accidents.  Options list (build sheet attached as image):"

First $26,000 takes it.  2006 Porsche Cayman S 32k miles Immaculate condition Clean title, no accident history  Features: Xenon HID head lamps 19\" Lobster claw wheels Bose sound system  Recent services: Synthetic oil change + filter (2k miles) Firestone Firehawk Indy 500 tires (500 miles, basically brand new). Rear: 265-35R19 Front: 235-35R19 Four wheel alignment performed by Johnson's Alignment (great alignment shop in SoCal) (500 miles)  I bought the car a few months ago and absolutely love it. It runs perfectly and has no issues whatsoever. I invested time and money into getting it just right (e.g. new tires, alignment, etc). Unfortunately, my wife and I have moved to Dallas and just don't have room for a second car anymore.  This means the Porsche needs to go.  If you are looking for a clean, properly sorted Porsche Cayman S, this is the car. I am looking for a clean transaction from a serious buyer: We will complete a bill-of-sale, sign over title, and transfer funds via cash or cashier's check at the Chase Bank in Dallas"

I bought it in November of 2016 from my local Porsche dealer, with around 27,000 miles on it, and have used it primarily for track use during the summers since. It currently has just under 40K miles on it, and has been well cared for and never crashed. I have saved most of the original parts where I have made track focused changes, and have not done anything that can't be reversed, with the exception of one hole drilled for a harness mount. This is a very nice car that is working well for me on the track, and is still pleasant to drive on the street.   If someone were to drive it on the street a lot, they would probably want quieter brake pads, less camber, and coilovers raised up to provide greater clearance. I'm happy to share additional photos and details. I'm considering selling because after a couple of unexpected job changes in the last couple of years it makes sense to have a cheaper toy than this, but if there isn't interest I'll probably end up keeping the car.   Upgraded parts: - Tarett cup series front control arms - Rear GT3 control arms with Elephant racing inner monoballs and Tarett thrust arm bushings - Tarett front and rear adjustable sway bars and end links - Tarett adjustable tie rod ends - Adjustable rear thrust arms - Long tube race headers - BC Racing coilovers with Hyperco springs (275# front and 400# rear) and BC Racing front upper strut mount monoballs and Elephant racing rear upper strut mount monoballs - Bodymotion carbon fiber front splitter - Coleman racing 355mm/14\" floating and slotted front brake rotors - Sebro slotted rear brake rotors - Race technologies RE10 brake pads - GT3 master cylinder - Goodridge stainless steel brake lines - Calipers rebuilt with Racing Brake stainless steel pistons and blue hi-temp boots - BGB four point harness bar - Sparco Grid II driver's seat - G-Force 6-point cam lock racing harness with 2\" shoulder straps for Hans Device - Fire extinguisher mounted in front of driver's seat - Front and rear tow loops - Rear carbon fiber wing mounted on extra hatch - Dark tinted side windows - 255/30R19 front tires on 19x9.5 Carerra S II wheels (original rear wheels from the car) - 295/30R19 rear wheels on 19x11 Carerra S II wheels from a 911 - I have an extra full set of used tires with some life left on them which I will include - GT2 front brake ducts (left front is damaged and could used replaced) - GT3 rear brake ducts - Castrol SRF brake fluid - Tarett wheel studs and lug nuts - Semi-solid transmission mounts - About 4K miles since oil change, air filter, spark plugs, new AOS, oil cooler seals replaced and new front wheel bearings (one felt slightly less than perfect so I replaced both because I track the car a fair amount and had the suspension apart anyway)  Factory options: - 250 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung (PDK) - 369 Standard Seats - 419 19\" Carrera S II Wheel - 619 Bluetooth Interface for Mobile Phone - 640 Sport Chrono Package Plus - 686 XM Radio - 810 Floor Mats in Interior Color - 870 Universal Audio Interface - A1 Black - AT Black Full Leather - P23 PCM 3.0 including Extended Navigation - P75 Bi-Xenon Headlights with Dynamic Cornering Lights  Original parts included with car that are not currently on the car: - Original rear hatch (wing is mounted to an extra black hatch I purchased) - Interior plastic pieces removed to mount harness bar - Driver's seat - Transmission mounts - Carerra S II front wheels - Factory sway bars - Factory splitters for front bumper - Headers / exhaust manifolds  I can be reached at 312-662-2961."

The chassis has 64,965 miles and the certified replacement motor has 51,000.     All work on the car was done by Porsche specialists Kelly-Moss Road and Race who replacemed the engine and went over every touch point while the motor was out. For some extra pep and a little grunt, a Fabspeed Exhaust plus K&N filter were added to get the Carrera breathing a bit better. For the corners, AST / Moton Dampers with Michelin tires were added to not only give the car a more aggressive look, but also increase road feel in turns while increasing ride comfort at the same time. Adding a lighter set of wheels around all corners, a new set of Michelin tires and a custom satin Wine Red wrap was installed in-house to complete the look! Kelly-Moss Road and Race has been in the Porsche business for over 30 years and did an outstanding job bringing this 997 back to life."

Paint and wheels are immaculate. My wife backed into it in the driveway about 6 months ago and dented the bumper. I took it to J&B Bodyworks (https://jbbodyworks.com/) which is Porsche certified (along with many other exotics) and had them replace the bumper and do a full paint correction of the entire vehicle to ensure a seamless match. I also had the windshield replaced due to some pitting that occurs over time and had the wheels refinished. It has brand new Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires with less than 200 miles on them. The improvement in ride quality and road noise from the previous Pirelli P-Zero tires is very noticeable. It has carbon fiber door sills and a Sharkwerks x-pipe (https://www.sharkwerks.com) which sounds amazing without being annoying.  I have two young children and unfortunately am just not finding the time to drive it. Located in lower Westchester County, NY."

I purchased in mid-2016, at which time, it was a mildly-built street car with a tuned, but factory 3.4.  I started to push the limits with more track time on aggressive suspension and tires, and the 3.4 fatally oil starved in late 2016.     I shipped the car to Bodymotion in NJ for assessment and rebuild. We chose a complete 4.2 liter motor from Vision Motorsports in California. The motor is bored and stroked from an X51 3.8S 997, with reworked heads, Carillo rods, JE pistons, custom knife-edge crank, and plenty of preventative oiling modifications.  Mileage at 4.2 install was 89,826. Proper break-in protocol followed for over 1,000 initial miles.  I have Vision's build sheet and warranty, which they consider proprietary, but will pass along to the next owner. The motor itself and installation was well over $50,000.  As listed below, I have progressively upgraded just about every aspect of the car over time.  It handles amazingly, remains in stellar aesthetic condition for a dedicated track car, and holds its own on the track against most cars short of PDK GTx models. I have not had the car on the dyno, as local access is spotty and unreliable.  Comparable builds should place it over 400 at the wheels.  I maintain the car religiously, and feed it Gibbs XP-9 oil and get Blackstone reports on each change (every 2 DEs).   The build highlights - in no particular order - are:  - Transmission rebuilt at 65k miles - Numeric short shift - Factory Porsche Cup shift cables - Wavetrac torque based biasing differential - Lightweight AASCO / Sachs clutch and flywheel combo (installed last season) - Front-mounted power steering cooler - Center radiator - Spek Pro Oil Pressure gauge where Sport Chrono clock would be (needs new sender) - Front and rear radiator screens - Heigo half cage  - Lexan engine cover - AC retained - Radio removed but retained  - Recaro Profi seats with Schroth harnesses - OMP Race steering wheel - Rennline pedal covers - Rennline aluminum track mats - Rennline tow hook - JRZ RS Touring 2 double adjustable coilovers - RS style door pulls - Tarret adjustable monoball front camber plates - Tarret monoball rear shock mounts - GT3 front sway bar - GT3 control arms on all corners - Tarret Drop links with rubber covered \"quiet\" Heim Joints - H&R rear sway bar - Tarret adjustable rear toe links - Rear axles replaced at 75k miles - Studded wheel carriers - GT3 Master Cylinder (SRF only) - Goodridge steel brake lines - GT3 front brake ducts - 997 GT3 front calipers (rebuilt last month) - Girodisc AP-style floating rotors - 325mm 2-piece rear rotors with adapter kit for rear calipers - Pagid Yellow pads (several sets) - 4.2 liter Vision Motorsports custom motor, tuned and retuned by Bodymotion - Fabspeed catless race headers - Fabspeed race exhaust - Fabspeed direct feed cold air intake (routes to external duct behind driver's side door) - GT3 throttle body - X51 plenum and manifolds - Custom Bodymotion deep sump with 2 drain plugs (holds an additional 3-4 quarts) - Undersized crank pulley and smaller drive belt - Porsche Motorsports AOS - Fenders rolled to fit 265 / 305 combo - One set OZ Alleggerita wheels - One set APEX wheels  - Getty carbon fiber front canards - Custom carbon fiber front splitter - Getty carbon fiber rear decklid spoiler and carbon GT-style wing - SST wing risers - Rennline rear subframe stabilizer with tie-down hooks  I exclusively use the car as a track toy, but it could be a dual-purpose car as well.  It is too loud for street driving as it sits, but the original headers and a milder muffler would remedy that.  It should pass emissions just about anywhere with those revisions (maybe fewer).  On softer settings, the JRZs are not intolerable at all.    Please feel free to ask questions, and PM for offers, or requests for more specific / detailed photos.  Thanks for looking.  "

Only reason I am selling is that after 18 months of back-and-forth with the city and engineers and architects our plans are FINALLY approved for a massive home remodel and we must move out for one year. I can only take one of my cars with me...  On to the Carrera:  - Last full year of 997.2 with all upgrades and improvements - Up to date on all maintenance. Impeccably maintained with Records back to almost the very beginning. Just had 40,000 mile service done and included spark plugs and brake flush. - Michelin Pilot Super Sports installed about 4K miles ago. - Prior owner was retired older gentleman who impeccably and anally maintained this vehicle. He purchased it from the original owner at around 20,000 miles as a CPO car. - Never tracked, always garaged stored and never abused. - Just did OEM motor mounts as I was past 6 year mark - Brakes are at 70% - Needs nothing  Option list attached in pics.  Upgrades/Mods: - NEW Fister Sport exhaust (sounds incredible, like it always should have!) - Sharkwerks X Pipe (have original center muffler) - Newly powder coated to PON Edition spec 19\" Carrera S II wheels in perfect condition - Clear front turn signal lenses - OEM satin black rear badge/script - Lloyd floor mats (have perfect originals) - Ceramic coated on all open body panels - PPF on the rest  Car is 9.9/10. No scratches, no dents, no accidents. Maybe 1-3 tiny rock chips. As mint as any 2011 I have ever seen. I have seen many!  This is priced very fairly considering KBB is $56,000 and this is the next classic as the last naturally aspirated 911 with hydraulic steering and the car is basically perfect. Please only contact me if you are serious about the vehicle. Low ***** will be politely ignored. Thank you.  Clean, clear title in hand. Carfax available for serious buyers.  619-577-3006     "

This 911 originally came pretty much fully loaded with highly sought after carbon ceramic brakes (PCCBs), sport exhaust, active suspension management (PASM), Sport Chrono, factory sport shifter, Bose stereo, and a beautiful and unique color combination of Speed Yellow over Cocoa Brown full leather interior highlighted with yellow seat belts. Original MSRP was $105,655!  It is in excellent condition, runs like a charm, no leaks, well-maintained, adult and enthusiast-owned, no pets/children, no smoking, always garaged. I just had the car professionally hand-washed, waxed, detailed, and vacuumed. It is ready to go for the new owner!  It had the IMS bearing upgraded/replaced in 2015, and a bunch of other maintenance (see below). Oil changed every 5-6,000 miles and I have three oil reports from Blackstone with normal or below normal levels on all readings during my ownership. This is the 5th 911 I've owned (previous 4 were air cooled) and it is definitely my favorite. I'm selling because I bought another Porsche 911.   Tastefully modified and handles/drives impeccably. All aesthetic body parts were professionally painted by Haury's Lake City except front lip. PPIs welcomed at any reputable shop in Seattle at buyer's expense.  Cash only, no trades. Local sale preferred but I will facilitate shipping at buyer's expense. Clean title and Porsche Certificate of Authenticity in hand. I also have the clean Carfax from when I bought the car and can share with prospective buyer as well as full records of maintenance since 2005. Thank you for looking.  Modifications:"
